      "front": "What is photosynthesis?",
      "back": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll."
    },
    {
      "front": "Which pigment is involved in photosynthesis?",
      "back": "Chlorophyll is the pigment involved in photosynthesis."
    },
    {
      "front": "True or False: Photosynthesis occurs in animals.",
      "back": "False. Photosynthesis occurs in green plants and some other organisms, not in animals."
    },
    {
      "front": "What is the primary function of photosynthesis?",
      "back": "The primary function of photosynthesis is to convert solar energy into chemical energy and then store that chemical energy for future use."
    },
    {
      "front": "What are the two stages of photosynthesis?",
      "back": "The two stages of photosynthesis are the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions."
    },
    {
      "front": "What is the chemical equation for photosynthesis?",
      "back": "The chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2."
    },
    {
      "front": "What is the primary source of energy for photosynthesis?",
      "back": "The primary source of energy for photosynthesis is sunlight."
    },
    {
      "front": "What is the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis?",
      "back": "Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and uses that energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen."
    },
    {
      "front": "What is the importance of photosynthesis?",
      "back": "Photosynthesis is important because it is the process by which green plants and some other organisms produce food and oxygen, which are essential for life on Earth."
    },
    {
      "front": "What is the difference between autotrophs and heterotrophs?",
      "back": "Autotrophs are organisms that can produce their own food through photosynthesis, while heterotrophs are organisms that rely on other organisms for food."
